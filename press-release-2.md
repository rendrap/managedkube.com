## ManagedKube Launches Tool to Provide Easy Point-and-Click Interface for Kubernetes in Slack on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketplace

**San Francisco, CA. May 16, 2019** – ManagedKube, a DevOps tool company, today announced its availability on Google Cloud Platform Marketplace (GCP Marketplace), providing customers with k8sBot, an app that provides a point-and-click user interface for Kubernetes in Slack.

GCP Marketplace lets users quickly deploy functional software packages that run on Google Cloud Platform. GCP Marketplace allows customers to easily start up a familiar software package with services like Compute Engine or Cloud Storage, with no manual configuration required.

Companies can now ensure that all their team members have access to Kubernetes information. ManagedKube’s k8sBot provides an easy-to-use interface in Slack so users can retrieve pod status, get pod logs, and get real-time troubleshooting recommendations with just one click. DevOps teams can get more done with k8sBot by easily sharing Kubernetes information in Slack where team discussions are already happening and automating DevOps support by democratizing access to Kubernetes information.

“We are proud to work closely with Google Cloud to launch our Kubernetes-focused productivity tool,” said Christie Lee, COO of ManagedKube. “This collaboration allows us to help companies integrate DevOps principles faster by removing knowledge and access barriers. Now, every team member can use the most common Kubernetes commands.”
