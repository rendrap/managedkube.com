                    <p class="text left white">
                            ManagedKube assembles a team with the right expertise to tackle each project. This is largely
                            dependant on the client’s internal team and the scope of the project. We have a number of DevOps
                            experts on our roster that we pull in as-needed for different projects.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <p class="text left white">
                            Because we are a small team, our projects are primarily short-term engagements that consist of
understanding what an organization most needs from their infrastructure, building that custom-tailored
system, and educating our client’s team on how to operate and maintain the system. We firmly
believe that the key to ManagedKube’s success and happy customers is our attitude towards
knowledge building. We freely share knowledge and teach what we know so we can develop our
client’s internal team and set them up for success after ManageKube’s contract is over.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <p class="text left white">
                            In practice, we work closely with our clients in a collaborative manner during architecturing and
project implementation to help them gain the operational insight and experience needed to operate
the environments. By taking this approach, we avoid a big “hand off” at the end of a project where
there is too much information to feasibly absorb. At the end of a project, our clients can confidently
operate the systems because they know how the system was built and why decisions were made.

                    <p class="text left blue">
                            ManagedKube takes a long-term view to its work. We show our clients the best techniques and
                            workflows to create the most efficient deployment processes over the lifetime of their software. We
                            have a strong point of view that DevOps teams should invest the time upfront to build infrastructure
                            and processes the right way from day one. This avoids incurring technical debt that you’ll pay back
                            many times in the future. You may save time today by building infrastructure in a quick and dirty
                            fashion, but we’ve seen this go awry too many times to count. We always advocate for the best long-
                            term solution for the entire system – the software and the business.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <p class="text left blue">
                            For example, in legacy IT environments, resources might not be expressed in code. This may be fine
when you first deploy something, but later on when you want to rebuild or build a new environment,
you’ll run into issues because the knowledge on how something was deployed is not readily available.
Since infrastructure is the foundation that everything else is built on top of, you want this piece to be
one of the most solid and reliable pieces of your stack. We practice infrastructure as code
methodologies with all of our clients. All infrastructure pieces should be built with code or
configurations that is easily testable and repeatable. This ensures that when anyone wants to make
a change in the future, they have all the information needed to do so safely.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <p class="text left blue">
                            We are also big proponents of a Gitflow workflow. With everything expressed as code or config, this
lends itself very well to a Gitflow process. We believe infrastructure code and configs should be
treated like any other piece of software and go through the same workflow. This usually means
branching off for new tastes, automated unit type testing, peer reviews before merging, and
automated deployments.

                    <p class="text left white">
                            Our philosophy is to leverage publicly available tools as much as possible - why build what has
                            already been built? We customize and integrate the right suite of tools, both open source and
                            proprietary, to meet the specific needs of each client.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <p class="text left white">
                            This practice saves our clients time and money by dramatically accelerating a project’s
                            progress. Software development has evolved to a point where infrastructure code is becoming more
                            and more commoditized. While software has a long way to go before it’s 100% turnkey, we leverage
                            the available infrastructure building blocks as much as possible.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <p class="text left white">
                            Our expertise lies in knowing what tools are available, the best tools to use, their benefits and
                            tradeoffs, and how they integrate with each other. Since we specialize in the infrastructure automation
                            and scaling space, we are well versed with what is out there and how each piece works together.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text left white">
                            Half the battle is knowing what tools are available - ManagedKube dedicates time to keeping up-to-
date on the tool landscape by constantly reading the latest DevOps blogs, attending meet-ups, and
being asked to evaluate the latest tools due to the nature of our consulting work.

                            This means that we understand what works, where. This hard-won experience and priceless
knowledge helps us quickly identify how to approach each client’s unique problem. The right solution
for a small company is likely not the right solution for a big company, just like the right level of
infrastructure automation is different for each company’s product. ManagedKube is experienced at
building scalable infrastructure for a wide range of companies and industries.
