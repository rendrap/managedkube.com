                <b>Access to an environment:</b> Give us access to an environment and we can perform additional checks on what was instantiated.  This could be the production environment or a pre-production environment, as long as it represents something close to the environment you want to use.  We will go through what was instantiated and provide recommendations on what area can use improvements.

			<p class="text left blue">
                <b>Review of the Audit: </b> We will talk to you one on one and go over the report on the audit performed on your code base and the running environment.  We will explain in detail what each item means and why we are recommending a change here.  This is also your time to ask an expert on general questions you or your team might have.
