layout: press
title: "My first press Title"
permalink: /press-one

This is an example md page of Press template. Please make sure the layout is **press**, not *post*!

Unlike blog posts, pleasekeep the md files in the root directory. 
Another difference is that you don't have to name the files with dates. I named this file 'my-first-press'. 

You can create a customized permalink. For instants, the permalink of this post is /press-one, so the full url is [https://managedkube.com/press-one][link]. If you leave the value of permalink blank, the permalink will be the file name.
